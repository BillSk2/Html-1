<p><B>Impressionism</B> is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes,  <br>
open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects <br>
of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception <br>
and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose <br>
independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.<br>
The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives<br>
from the title of a Claude Monet work,Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which provoked the critic<br> 
Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari.<br>
The development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that <br>
became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.</p>
