	<p> Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in European classical music that arose in the late 19th century and continued into 
	the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional 
	excesses of the Romantic era. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the nocturne, arabesque, and prelude, and often explored uncommon scales 
	such as the whole tone scale. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of 
	chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies. </p>
	
	<p>The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are generally considered the 
	greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. Erik Satie was also considered in this category, 
	though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. Paul Dukas is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, 
	but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as 
	Ottorino Respighi (Italy) Ralph Vaughan Williams, Cyril Scott, and John Ireland (England), and Manuel De Falla, and Isaac Albeniz (Spain).</p>
	
	<p>The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory 
	impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to Symbolism, with its major exemplars being Baudelaire, 
	Mallarm√©, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. Authors such as Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and Joseph Conrad have written works that are Impressionistic 
	in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life. </p>
